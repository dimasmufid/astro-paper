I'm Dimas Mufid. Born and raised in Indonesia. I started my career working as a data engineer and software engineer across startups.

## My Career Journey

I don't have any technical background when I started my career. In my journey of getting management degree, I meet statistics and interested on it. That is the tipping point for me to start my career in data field, starting as a **Data Analyst** in [entrefine](https://entrefine.com/), a consultant startup that help a small and medium enterprise to optimize data for their business growth.

Then there is a point where one of the client have a large amount of data that need to be process. In that point, I learn anything about data warehouse in [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery) and also my first meet with [Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) for building ELT data pipeline. So my data engineering learning journey is even I learn it accidentally. But apparently, it is become the field that I love the most to work with.

But unfortunately, the output of data engineering is data infrastructure. It is not something that will face directly into the end user. That is the point where then I start learning about web development. Big thanks to [the odin project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) for providing free and comprehensive web development curriculum. That later I learn more about [nextjs](https://nextjs.org/) and [fastapi](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) that become my main weapon for building software system.

## Building Nesra

Now, the **Next Big Thing** for me is building Nesra! It is an AI Lab that focus building digital product that focus on **Data Analytics and AI**. I will share about it more for each project that I build inside Nesra.
